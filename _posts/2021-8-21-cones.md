title: Volume of a Cone
---
Here, I will show you how to derive the formula of a cone, using volumes of revolution.

If we rotate this line 360 degrees about the x axis, we get the shape of a cone:

![cone]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cone.png)

But what exactly is the volume of this shape?

Firstly, let's find an equation for that line. If we say that the point shown has coordinates (h,r), where h will be the height of the cone, and r will be the radius, then the equation of the line passing through that point and the origin is y = (r/h) x.

So, y^2 = (r^2/h^2) x^2.

If we integrate y^2 with respect to x between 0 and h, we get:

(hr^2)/3

Then, if we multiply this by π, we get the volume of this shape rotated around the x axis:

π(hr^2)/3

Or,

1/3 * π * r^2 * h
